A small torch, hanging from the wall, brings a little bit of light to this weird, dugout room.
Rats screaming and running away from almost every small corner or hidden place and leave you with brief silence.
Theres a small oddly looking table, containing the rest of what seems to have been someones lunch and very small leather bag, someone left in hurry!.
After looking a round, the silence gets interrupted by the same distant growling you have been hearing earlier
