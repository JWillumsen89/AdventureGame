Water erupting from a small crack in the ceiling creates a small pond that seems to be continuing into a small stream that disappears through the crack in the cave floor.
By the water there a very oddly skeleton, that thankfully is not alive. Because those pointer teeth and sharp claws, must have injured somebody badly.
Thorn fabric and a dagger is beside it. Someone barely escaped this still alive.
