Everything suddenly changes.
This area is nicely dugout, there is monuments, torches that light up the room and cages.
But something is off, some of the monuments are smashed, claws marks, old blood marks and a weird quite atmosphere.
In the corner is a big cage, broken, smashed actually! Something big was here!
